Every morning, I begin by waking up to the soft glow of sunlight
filtering through the curtains, gently easing into the day with a
few moments of quiet reflection. After stretching my limbs and
taking a deep breath to invigorate my senses, I head to the kitchen
to brew a fragrant cup of coffee, the rich aroma signalling the start
of a new day. Sipping the warm elixir, I leisurely peruse the
morning headlines, catching up on the latest events while the
world slowly comes to life outside my window. With caffeine fueling
my energy, I embark on a brisk walk through the neighbourhood, soaking
in the sights and sounds of nature awakening. Returning home, I relish
a wholesome breakfast, savouring each bite as I plan the day with a sense of
anticipation and purpose.
